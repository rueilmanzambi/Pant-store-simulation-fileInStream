### Some helpful tips:
1) 2 space indents for your indentation scheme.
2) Use constants for numbers that are important and won't change.
   e.g. my_int % 2 for testing if a number is even is not important (don't need a const for 2)
        Homer's IQ (from HW1 in 2020-FA) was assigned in the HW and represents something, so it's important (should have been a const)

### Some Grading Info:
1) -1 for every literal you have that should be a constant (max 15)
2) -5 for not using 2 space indents
3) -10 for incorrect output values
4) -5 for bad output (non-descriptive, sloppy, etc.) formatting
5) -30 for non-compiling code
6) -10 for using things that were not covered in class or you were told you can't use (for example, the math library. If you can use it, we will tell you)
7) -5 for each function without the specified documentation (pre/post/desc) (max 15)
8) -5 for any code that should be a function but isn't
9) -5 for having bloated functions (too much stuff in a function. They should do specific tasks, not a bunch of tasks)
10) We use a program to compile and run your code. If you include user inputs out of order or add inputs we don't ask for in the
    assignment, it WILL prevent us from auto-running the code. So please don't do that.

### Remember:
Throughout the semester you can ask Henry and myself (Richie) for help in the class and with the work. We are available via email (Henry: henrycwong@mst.edu Richie rerc7r@mst.edu) or on the 1570 Discord (@HWong#4863 and @Richie#0508)

### Git Help

Some of you may not be familiar with git still, so here are the basic steps:

* Clone the repo using the "clone/download" and copy the link in the HTTPS box.
* Create a cs1570 folder in your SDRIVE if you don't have one already: mkdir cs1570 and cd cs1570 so you're inside the folder.
* git clone the-link-you-copied
* This should create a folder called 2020-SP-CS1570-hwX. You can now cd into that folder.
* Whenever you create a new file git will track your changes and you can add your file to the repo by doing git add filename.ext
* Now we can "commit" our file! You need to add a message with your commit to briefly explain what your changes are. git commit -m "I made a file with my name in it!". The message will show up in your git repo, so be careful of what you write.
* Finally you can "push" your changes to the git repo! git push  is all you need to do, it'll ask you to login with your info so once you login you'll be done.
